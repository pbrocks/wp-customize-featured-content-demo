## Description ##

This plugin provides an advanced demonstration of how to build a customizer interface for selecting items to feature on your site.
Items have a title, URL, and featured image which are pulled from an optional related post or they can be selectively overridden as desired.

This plugin depends on first having the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/customize-object-selector/">Customize Object Selector</a> plugin installed and activated. Without this plugin active, you won't be able to select a related post and will have to enter the title, featured image, and URL for each item.

A `[featured_items]` shortcode is included, allowing you to render the featured items in any page or post.

You may also render the items as part of your theme with the following example code which renders the items on the front page:

```php
<?php if ( is_front_page() && function_exists( '\Customize_Featured_Content_Demo\render_items' ) ) : ?>
	<?php \Customize_Featured_Content_Demo\render_items(); ?>
<?php endif; ?>
```
